## 1. Introduction  
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remain a significant driver of climate change with supply chains playing a pivotal role in industrial carbon footprints. Understanding the sources and levels of emissions within supply chains can support industries in adopting more sustainable practices and inform environmental policy decisions. This project focuses on analyzing GHG emissions from various industries based on supply chain activities.

## 2. Objective  
The primary objective of this project is to identify and visualize the industries contributing most to supply chain-related GHG emissions. The goal is to provide stakeholders with clear insights into where emissions are concentrated enabling data-driven environmental strategies and mitigation efforts.

## 3. Dataset Overview  
The dataset is derived from the 2017 NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) Title codes and includes values for supply chain GHG emission factors both with and without margins. The data captures industry-specific metrics across various sectors such as mining agriculture and manufacturing.

### Key Features:
- NAICS Industry Titles  
- Emission factors with margins  
- Emission factors without margins  
- Industry classifications by emission scale  

## 4. Methodology  
The methodology adopted for this project involves the following steps:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Extraction of the Top 10 Industries with the Highest GHG Emissions  
3. Comparative Analysis of Emission Factors with and without Margins  
4. Visualization using bar and line charts to highlight differences and trends  

## 5. Research Questions  
- Which industries contribute the most to supply chain-related GHG emissions?  
- How do emission factors change when margins are considered?  
- What patterns emerge across the sectors with the highest emissions?

## 6. Process  
- Loaded and examined the dataset using analytical tools  
- Aggregated the emission values based on industry type  
- Visualized emissions using top-performing industries for clarity  
- Compared supply chain emissions with and without margins to understand variance  

## 7. Insights  
- Mining-related industries dominate the list when margins are included indicating their high operational impact  
- Agricultural sectors such as wheat farming and rice farming show significant emissions particularly without margins  
- Margins significantly influence the ranking of industries changing the perceived environmental impact  
- Some sectors like solid waste and cement production consistently appear across both comparisons showing consistently high emissions

## 8. Key Findings  
- Potash soda and borate mineral mining exhibits the highest margin-based supply chain emissions  
- Wheat farming ranks highest in emission factors without margins pointing to its environmental footprint from direct supply chain activities  
- Bituminous coal surface mining and industrial sand mining also show substantial emission margins  
- Emission rankings differ based on whether margins are considered indicating the importance of comprehensive analysis in policy formation

## 9. Conclusion  
This study underscores the need for targeted emission reduction efforts in high-impact sectors such as mining and agriculture. The inclusion or exclusion of margins significantly alters emission perceptions suggesting the necessity for transparent and complete data in emission reporting. Future efforts should integrate real-time data and explore decarbonization opportunities in the most affected supply chains.
